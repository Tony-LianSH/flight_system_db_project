# flight_system_db_project
 
This is the final project of Databases course. It aims to build an online Air Ticket Reservation System. Using this system, customers can search for flights, purchase flights ticket, view their upcoming flight status or see their past flights etc. 

There will be three types of users of this system - Customers, Booking Agents and Airline Staff (Administrator). Booking Agents will book flights for other Customers, can get a fixed commission. They can view their monthly reports and get total commission. Airline Staff will add new airplanes, create new flights, and update flight status. In general this will be simple air ticket reservation system.

The [templates](/templates) contains the html files written with jinja2. The [server](server2.0.py) is the mainly file that contains the back end codes.

Note: The program runs on a local server for the course and cost convenience.
